Lately, I have started doing more and more with JavaScript. I've developed some useful snippets that I use in a new project that I am currently working on. One of these snippets is something that I have been looking for since a long time: a good way of displaying a collapsable tree in a table. If you don't understand what I mean then you should open your favorite file explorer in your operating system. Almost all of these applications have a way of displaying a directory structure in a tabular format. The leftmost column commonly shows a tree of your directories with several columns on the right containing additional information on your files and folders, and each directory can be expanded/collapsed. This is what I wanted to display in a web browser, using a `table`.

After jotting down the structure and design on a piece of paper I downloaded the latest version of [jQuery](http://jquery.com), read some documentation on [authoring plugins](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring) and started coding. And now, twenty-four hours later, this is the result:

My very first jQuery plugin! ActsAsTreeTable allows you to turn a column in your table into a tree. The plugin has been made as unobtrusively as possible and I have posted it to the jQuery plugin index as [ActsAsTreeTable 1.0](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/acts_as_tree_table). To make it as easy as possible to start using the plugin I have also written some [documentation](http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-plugins/acts_as_tree_table/doc/index.html). You will also find several [examples](http://ludo.cubicphuse.nl/jquery-plugins/acts_as_tree_table/doc/index.html#examples) in this documentation.
