My dear colleague [Ariejan](http://ariejan.net) seems to be starting a discussion, that, from what I can tell, is actually a non-discussion. But perhaps someone needs a reminder, so let's all vote for the correct answer to the following question: awesome or epic?

At least [307,688,999](http://www.census.gov/population/www/popclockus.html) people (number at time of writing) will know the answer since they use it every day. For the rest of the world: I do not want to influence you, but I know that you know which answer is awesome.
