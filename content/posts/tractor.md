Move along, there's nothing to see here. That is what this tractor was trying to tell me while I was about to take the first photograph of his old, rusty body. After a few clicks the tractor seemed to get used to the attention it was getting. Even the sun would show itself for a few minutes. The tractor didn't say a word, but it looked like it was just as surprised as me that the sun was able to punch a hole in the large and heavy clouds floating along slowly, high above our heads.

With the clouds fighting hard to hide the small bits of clear blue sky, it was time for me to move along.
