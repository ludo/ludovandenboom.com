      <description>Move along, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing to see here. That is what this tractor was trying to tell me while I was about to take the first photograph of his old, rusty body. After a few clicks the tractor seemed to get used to the attention it was getting. Even the sun would show itself for a few minutes. The tractor didn&amp;rsquo;t say a word, but it looked like it was just as surprised as me that the sun was able to punch a hole in the large and heavy clouds floating along slowly, high above our heads.</description>
